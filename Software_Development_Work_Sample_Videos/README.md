Sample videos of some of the tools developed by me.

Technology stack used for these tools: 

* Front end - HTML, CSS - Matrialise CSS, JS/JQuery, AngularJS, UML diagram Generator (PlantUML)
* Middleware services - NodeJS services, Java Services
* Backend - Java, ANTLR

1. <b>Liferay to Angular Converter:</b>
* Overview: Converts a code written in Liferay to Angular (generated angular html, css and ts equivalent)

2. <b>Java Code Classifier:</b>
* Overview: Splits a single java file with many functions into meaningful classes as suggested by the user.
* Video References: CodeClassifier

3. <b>Java Code Modeller:</b>
* Overview: Given a single java file, this tool allows to model the class as per the user's choice by presenting a UML class diagram (explains the Java class in lay man's terms), with which the user can separate the file into multiple classes, add functions and variables to the class, and knit the classes together.

4. <b>C++ to Java Code Converter:</b>
* Overview: Converts the given C++ code to Java and generates a UML activity diagram to explain the code flow in lay man's terms.
* Video References: Cpp_to_Java

5. <b>Fortran to Java Code Converter</b>
* Overview: Converts the given Fortran code to Java and generates different UML diagrams (state, activity and class diagrams) to explain the code flow in lay man's terms. The tool also has an inbuild command line where the user can run the generated Java code.
